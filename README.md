I'm a dedicated data scientist and enthusiastic learner, committed to uncovering meaningful insights from complex datasets. With a strong background in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, specializing in transforming intricate data into actionable insights and creating impactful solutions. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently enhancing the efficiency of my ETL workflows, particularly in data extraction and processing. In the [Data Pipeline Workflow](https://github.com/Hannah-Ajibola/Stock-Market-Data-Pipeline.git), I successfully automated the collection of stock market prices using Python with scheduled API calls, seamlessly processing the data into an SQL server.
